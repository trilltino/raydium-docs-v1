# `scripts/`

Tooling for the Raydium docs repo. Currently:

- [`translate.py`](./translate.py) — batch translator that turns the English source tree into locale-specific MDX, page by page, via the Anthropic API.

## `translate.py` — batch translator

Walks the English source under `docs/en` and writes translated files under each target locale in `docs/i18n` (`docs/i18n/zh/`, `docs/i18n/zh-Hant/`, `docs/i18n/ja/`, `docs/i18n/ko/`, `docs/i18n/ru/`, `docs/i18n/es/`, `docs/i18n/de/`, `docs/i18n/fr/`, etc.).

It preserves frontmatter keys, code fences, JSX components, internal-link structure, Solana program IDs and account/instruction names. It rewrites internal `/docs/en/<path>` links to `/docs/i18n/<locale>/<path>` and inserts the AI-translation banner at the top of every translated page.

### Setup

```bash
pip install anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

### Translate everything

```bash
python3 scripts/translate.py
```

This translates ~154 pages × 8 locales = ~1,232 jobs. With default concurrency of 8 and Sonnet, expect ~30–60 minutes wall-time and a small number of dollars in API spend (depending on page sizes; bulk of the corpus is short-to-medium pages).

By default it **skips** any target file that is no longer a stub — i.e. anything someone has hand-translated or hand-edited. Re-running is safe; only stubs get touched.

### Translate just one locale

```bash
python3 scripts/translate.py --locales ja
```

### Translate just a few pages

```bash
python3 scripts/translate.py \
  --paths docs/en/products/cpmm/overview.mdx,docs/en/products/clmm/overview.mdx \
  --locales zh,zh-Hant
```

### Force overwrite (replace existing translations)

```bash
python3 scripts/translate.py --overwrite
```

Useful after upstream English edits that should propagate to all locales.

### Dry run

```bash
python3 scripts/translate.py --dry-run
```

Lists every (locale, page) job and what would happen to it. No API calls, no disk writes.

### Other knobs

- `--model claude-sonnet-4-5` — pick a different model.
- `--concurrency 16` — more in-flight requests.

### Log

Every run appends to `scripts/translate.log` with timestamp, locales, page count, model, and per-job status. Useful for spotting which pages errored so you can re-run them.

### What gets translated vs. preserved

**Translated:** prose, headings (when not code identifiers), markdown link visible text, JSX `title=` and `description=` props when they're user-facing strings, table cell text, alt text, frontmatter `title` and `description`.

**Not translated:** code fences, inline code, frontmatter keys (other than title/description), JSX prop names, JSX prop values that look like URLs/identifiers/icons, Solana addresses, PDA names, instruction/account/struct names, math expressions.

**Internal-link rewriting:** `[X](/docs/en/foo)` becomes `[X-translated](/docs/i18n/<locale>/foo)`. Anchor-only and external links untouched. Already-localized links untouched.

### When to re-run

- You added a new English page → run with `--paths <new-page-path>`.
- You substantially edited an existing English page → run with `--overwrite --paths <edited-page>`.
- Anthropic releases a new model and you want fresher translations → run with `--overwrite --model <new-model>`.
- Hand-translation by a community contributor → no action; the script will skip it on subsequent runs.

### Cost ballpark

A typical Raydium docs page is ~400 lines / ~12 KB. Sonnet at ~$3/M input + $15/M output → ≤ $0.05 per translated page. Full corpus run: ~$50–80 across 1,232 jobs. Halve that if you skip the longer chapters.
