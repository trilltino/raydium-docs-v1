# Raydium Documentation

Community-maintained reference and guides for [Raydium](https://raydium.io) — the AMM v4, CPMM, CLMM, Farm/Staking, and LaunchLab programs on Solana, plus the Perps integration on top of Orderly Network.

This repository is the source for the documentation site. Built on [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com); pages are MDX files with YAML frontmatter; navigation is configured in [`docs.json`](./docs.json). The information architecture, audience model, and per-chapter writing brief live in [`ARCHITECTURE.mdx`](./ARCHITECTURE.mdx).

## What's inside

- **171 pages** across 15 top-level chapters: Introduction, Protocol Overview, Getting Started, User Flows, Solana Fundamentals, Products (AMM v4 / CPMM / CLMM / Farm-Staking / Perps / Stable AMM / AMM Routing / LaunchLab — LaunchLab includes a Tips & Gotchas sub-folder), Algorithms, Quick Start, SDK & API, Integration Guides, Security, RAY token & Protocol revenues, API Reference, Reference, Resources.
- **Three audience tracks** in parallel: developers/integrators, protocol researchers/auditors, and end users. Every chapter is tagged with the audience it primarily serves.
- **Runnable code** for every instruction-level surface — TypeScript, Rust, and Python — pinned to specific SDK versions and program IDs.
- **Multi-language.** Source of truth is English under `docs/en`. Thirteen locales (`zh`, `zh-Hant`, `ja`, `ko`, `ru`, `es`, `de`, `fr`, `pt`, `tr`, `vi`, `id`, `ar`) are mirrored under `docs/i18n`; MDX content is kept in sync by Mintlify's auto-translation. Translators are welcome to PR corrections — see [`CONTRIBUTING.md § Translations`](./CONTRIBUTING.md#translations).

## Contributing

This is an open-source documentation set. **Issues and pull requests are welcome from anyone** — corrections, new examples, missing edge cases, clarifications, fresh diagrams, or entirely new pages are all in scope.

- Found a bug, a stale code sample, a broken link, or a confusing explanation? [**Open an issue**](https://github.com/raydium-io/raydium-docs-v1/issues/new).
- Have a fix or an addition ready? [**Open a pull request**](https://github.com/raydium-io/raydium-docs-v1/compare).
- Want to discuss a larger change before writing it? Open an issue first so we can align on scope.

Before contributing, please read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) — it covers the writing style, the per-product page template, version-pin requirements for code samples, and the PR checklist.

New contributors: anything labeled `good first issue` is a low-risk way in.

## Run the docs locally

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) ≥ 18 and the Mintlify CLI:

```bash
npm i -g mint
```

Then, from the repo root (where `docs.json` lives):

```bash
mint dev
```

The site renders at `http://localhost:3000`. Edits hot-reload.

To check for broken internal links before committing:

```bash
mint broken-links
```

Local source/research checkouts should live beside this repo, not inside it. For example, use `C:\Users\isich\raydium-docs-research` locally so Mintlify only scans the docs project.

URLs follow the content tree in `docs.json`, e.g. `/docs/en/products/cpmm/overview` for English and `/docs/i18n/zh/products/cpmm/overview` for Simplified Chinese. Visitors with a matching browser preference are served the localized tree where pages are translated and the English version where they aren't. Legacy `/en/<path>` URLs redirect to `/docs/en/<path>`.

## Editorial conventions

- **One topic, one home.** Concepts are defined in exactly one chapter and linked from others. See `ARCHITECTURE.mdx § Design principles`.
- **Version-pin code samples.** Every code-heavy page declares the SDK version, program ID, Solana cluster, and last-verified date near the top.
- **Separate "how it works" from "how to use it."** Algorithms live in `algorithms/`; user flows live in `user-flows/`. Product chapters link both ways.
- **Security is a first-class chapter, not a footnote.** Auditors should not have to grep product chapters.
